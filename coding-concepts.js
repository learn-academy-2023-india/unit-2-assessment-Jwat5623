// ASSESSMENT 2: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain WHY your initial answer was correct or incorrect.
// There is no need to change any of the code.

// --------------------1) What will this log?

const cohort = "India 2023"
console.log(cohort.split(" "))

// a) Your answer: its going to separate the two strings
// b) Verify and explain: it printed exactly what i expected because the split built in method that converts a string into an array and the space in between the quotations separates them into two strings in an array

// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeter = (name) => {
  `Hello, ${name}!`
}
console.log(greeter("LEARN Student"))

// a) Your answer: it will be an error
// b) Verify and explain: I was close, it printed undefined because not enough information was put into the function

// --------------------3) What will this log?

const onlyOdds = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15].filter((number) => number % 2 !== 0)
console.log(onlyOdds)

// a) Your answer: it will print all the odd numbers from the array
// b) Verify and explain: it printed out the odd numbers because the iterative method .filter calls back everything needed from the argument

// --------------------4) What will this log?

const myCodingSkills = {
  languages: ["JavaScript", "Ruby"],
  frameworks: ["React", "Ruby on Rails"],
  databases: "PostgreSQL",
  versionControl: "GitHub"
}
console.log(myCodingSkills.languages[0])

// a) Your answer: Javascript
// b) Verify and explain: Javascript is at the zeroth index in the array so Javascript prints when trying to log the zero or first value in array

// --------------------5) What will this log?

class Learn {
  constructor(name) {
    this.student = name
    this.cohort = "India"
    this.year = 2023
  }
}
const learnStudent = new Learn("George")
console.log(learnStudent)

// a) Your answer: it will add George as the student name
// b) Verify and explain: George was added as a value inside of the student key
