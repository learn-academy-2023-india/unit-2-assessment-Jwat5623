# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions
<!-- Test -->
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions:

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: a parameter is something that you want to pass through the argument, a argument is the action that you're giving your function.

Researched answer: A parameter is one of the variables in a function. And when a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: an object is a collection that holds the keys and values. a class is the blueprint for a object

Researched answer: A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: a line of code that you want to repeat until a certaion condition is met.

Researched answer: Iteration occurs when we want to execute code once for each item in a collection, usually elements in an array or properties of an object. Common looping methods are 'for' loops, 'while' loops and 'do… while' loops.

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Inevitably, this means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. React State: What Is 'State' in ReactJS? The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

2. React Props: In ReactJS, the props are a type of object where the value of attributes of a tag is stored. The word “props” implies “properties”, and its working functionality is quite similar to HTML attributes. Basically, these props components are read-only components.

3. JSX: JSX (JavaScript Syntax Extension and occasionally referred to as JavaScript XML) is a JavaScript extension that allows creation of DOM trees using an XML-like syntax. Initially created by Facebook for use with React, JSX has been adopted by multiple web frameworks.
